# Thanos-Snap
I made this little program after I first watched Avengers: Infinity war.

The program is a for loop that runs 8 billion times (resembeling everyone on earth) and randomly either turns them to dust or spares them... For the good of the Galaxy.  The numbers next to the message shows the total number of spared/dusted.
